# A02
Create a tutorial on how to use GitHub inside of the Readme.MD file

Create a GitHub Repository called A02

1) Create a GitHub account.

2) Create a new repository in GitHub called A02. Use a capital A in A02 as it makes a difference.

3) Enter the required information into the README.MD

4) SUBMIT the Repository link to Canvas.

The repository URL should be of the form:

https://github.com/yourUCID/A02

For Example:

https://github.com/ahhendela/A02

 

Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm or another editor, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.

This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.

PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

 

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.
