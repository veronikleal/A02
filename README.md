Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

-Branch: "Is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Clone:"A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Commit: "A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash" that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when)

-Fetch: You are adding changes from the remote repository to your local working brand without committing them. (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-GIT: "An open source program for tracking changes in text files" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Github: "Is a cloud based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code" (Github Docs, n.d.-b)

-Merge: "Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Merge Conflict: "A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merges conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file." (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Push:"You update the remote branch with changes from your local branch" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Pull: "When you are fetching in changes and merging them" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Remote: "The version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely Github.com" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)

-Repository: "They are easiest to imagine as project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history" (Github Docs, n.d.-a)
